       ## Design: 
      ### Colours: 
             
       
                I looked at the website coolors, (https://coolors.co/) to give me inspiration, however I chose my own colour palette for this website. 
                The deliberate use of light and pastel colours is to emmulate a neat and tidy environment, appealing to prospective customers and 
                those who visit the webiste. </p>
             
     ### Typography: 
                         
                 I chose Martian Mono and Roboto from Google Fonts as I believe they compliment each-other nicely, with clear and simple text. </p>

        ## Wireframe Design Using Balsamiq: 
        
             I used Balsamiq to help plan out the design of the website. I deviated slightly from it as when challenges arose through coding and different styling was needed.

             ## Future Implementations:              
             
             
                 In the future I would add a larger gallery of work done, a price list and perhaps some styling of the social media section through favicon. 
             
             
             ## Technology Used: 
             
             
            ### Languages: 
             
             
              HTML and CSS were used to make this website. 
             
             
            
            ## Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used: 
           
                 1 Github was to used to save and store code. 
                 2 Google Fonts was used to import fonts for my website. 
                 3 Iconography was imported from Font Awesome. 
                 4 W3C was used to learn and implement code. 
                 5 Balsamiq was used to create the basic wireframe design of the website. 
             
             
          
             
            ## Deployment: 
            
              I used GitHub Pages to deploy the website.
                 
             
             ### To Deploy Using GitHub Pages: 
             
             
             
               1 Login/Sign- Up to Github.

            # Testing:
           
                     I tested my website out on my laptop, my computer, my phone, relative's phones and tablets and on my Xbox. 
            The website ran nicely on all devices. 
          
           
           
           ## Bugs Found 
           
           I had a number of small issues arise during my initial testing and when I looked back over the code itself one line at a time, after rectifying this the website was much more responsive, however I am learning more about flex-box implementation and I intend to become far more knowledgable with the use of them to help with responsiveness.
