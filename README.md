             <h2> Design: </h2>
             <h3> Colours: </h3>
             <br>
            <p> 
                I looked at the website coolors, (https://coolors.co/) to give me inspiration, however I chose my own colour palette for this website. 
                The deliberate use of light and pastel colours is to emmulate a neat and tidy environment, appealing to prospective customers and 
                those who visit the webiste. </p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <h3> Typography: </h3>
            <br>
             <p>
                 I chose Martian Mono and Roboto from Google Fonts as I believe they compliment each-other nicely, with clear and simple text. </p>
             <br>

             <h2> Wireframe Design Using Balsamiq: </h2>
             <p> I used Balsamiq to help plan out the design of the website. I deviated slightly from it as when challenges arose through coding and different styling was needed. </p>
