  ## Design: 
  ### Colours: 
             
       
I looked at the website coolors, (https://coolors.co/) to give me inspiration, however I chose my own colour palette for this website. 
The deliberate use of light and pastel colours is to emmulate a neat and tidy environment, appealing to prospective customers and 
those who visit the webiste. 
             
  ### Typography: 
                         
I chose Martian Mono and Roboto from Google Fonts as I believe they compliment each-other nicely, with clear and simple text. </p>

  ## Wireframe Design Using Balsamiq: 
        
  I used Balsamiq to help plan out the design of the website. I deviated slightly from it as when challenges arose through coding and different styling was needed.

   ## Future Implementations:

  ## Bugs Found 
          
  I had a number of small issues arise during my initial testing and when I looked back over the code itself one line at a time, I found stray divs, missing paragraphs and small things like that. After rectifying this the website was much more responsive, passed all of the testing etc. However I am learning more about flex-box implementation and I intend to become far more experienced with the use of them to help with responsiveness.
         
          
             

                    
  ##Credits
  
  
  How to make and layout a README.md file was inspired by the presentation found on GitHub by Kera Cudmore.
  
  ###Code
          
Some of the coding I have learned and inspired my own is from such sites as:

Used :

https://www.w3schools.in/html/blink-tag

 to teach me how to use a blink tag


I used "https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-mailto-links.html" as a  guide to learn and implement my contact emails that I used in the website. 

Booking Form : 

I used https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp to help with my booking formation.

I also took inspiration from the "Love-Running Project" Taught by Code Institute as it was fresh in my mind, I enjoyed the process and I wanted to honour my first my first-webpage made by me by implementing snips of coding.

### Media

All of the photos used in the making of my website were taking from the websites Pexels [https://www.pexels.com/search/free%20images/].

The icons were taken from font-awesome [https://fontawesome.com/]

The fonts were imported from Google Fonts [https://fonts.google.com/]

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my family for their patience on this new journey I am under-taking. 
I would like to thank my fellow students who are all very supportive. 
To the staff at Code Institute who are incredibly quick to respond and point me in the right direction.
